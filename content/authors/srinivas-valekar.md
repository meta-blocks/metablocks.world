shortBio: Lead Blockchain Developer Meta Blocks
---
Hey there ü§ô I'm buidling Meta Blocks Protocol which is an upgradable NFT protocol built on Solana.

# What do I do at Meta Blocks?

My responsibilities include leading blockchain development, and making other developers life easier by building libraries

# Background

I have worked with cloud technologies like SAP Business Platform. While working at SAP, I built an enterprise app called "Trusty" in 2021. Trusty facilitated agreements between tenants and property owners using Solana.

I am a full-stack developer with over 9 years of experience. I aped into crypto in 2017 after buying first batch of Bitcoin and Ethereum. I recently moved to Solana and have decided to stick in web3 for a while.

Crypto investments accelerated my crypto learning journey. I started building smart contracts early in the year 2020. In late 2020, I picked up Solana. I have contributed to the Solana OS eco-system in the form of his tools: [NFT lending](https://github.com/valekar/nft-lending), [NFT staking](https://github.com/valekar/nft-vault), [NFT minting](https://github.com/lamports/router) and Arweave Binder(https://github.com/lamports/arweave-binding).
