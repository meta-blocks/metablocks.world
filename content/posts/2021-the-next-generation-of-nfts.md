The NFT Craze of 2021 has turned the eyes of the world to NFTs and digital ownership. While 2021 was a successful cultural movement that brought the concept of digital ownership to mainstream media, the questions is "What's next?"

The influx of PFP projects in the later half of 2021 is a testament to the fact that "6900 Pictures of Sci-Fi Cats" isn't cutting it anymore. If you're a part of any NFT server on Discord, I'm sure you must recieve dozens of DMs about an "exciting new project". 

The "Mona Lisa(s)" and "The Last Supper(s)" of the NFT world have already made their mark in hisotry, now we need to look forward.  

## What's the next generation of NFTs? What's the Future of NFTs? 

NFTs have surged in popularity, but have largely remained static. [Stephen Fluin](https://twitter.com/stephenfluin) of [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link/) took the stage at "Enter the Metaverse" conference to talk about the future of NFTs. 

> The next generation of NFTs, will be dynamic - flexible, adaptable, and capable of responding to external cues and data to level up their capabilities.

Examples of upgrading NFTs 

SolSoldiers 

Genopets

CloneX

PenguLove 

Aquisition Royale

Async Art 

The next generation of NFTs is dynamic, composable and upgradeable. However, the few rare projects (including the ones that aren't mentioned abouve) that are working on upgradeable NFTs are using proprietary solutions to make their NFTs dynamic. 

If every new project in the future has build a proprietary to make their NFTs dynamic, it would be as if each generation of hamanity had to rediscover the fire by themselves. We'd be millenniums behind as a species!
