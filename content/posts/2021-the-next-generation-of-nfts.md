Via Into the Metaverse 

NFTs have surged in popularity over the past few months, but have largely remained static. The next generation of NFTs, powered by oracles, will be dynamic - flexible, adaptable, and capable of responding to external cues and data to level up their capabilities. This talk will review how NFTs have progressed over time, where they're going next, and how new use cases made possible by oracle connectivity stand to revolutionize the sector.
