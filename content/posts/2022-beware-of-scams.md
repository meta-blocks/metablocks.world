A member of our community Discord recently messaged us about a DM they received on Twitter. 

It was an account that pretended to be a Meta Blocks employee. The DM contained links to our site and an explanation of the idea. The scammer continued by requesting the target to download a software to help us test our system. 

Here's a screenshot of the conversation:

Meta Blocks is a suite of smart contracts that run on-chain. We will never DM you to download any files to your system, or ask for your seed phrase. 

If you come across such scams, please report it to Twitter and DM us about it. Stay safe <3
