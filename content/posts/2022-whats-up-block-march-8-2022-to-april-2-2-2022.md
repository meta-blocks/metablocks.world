In our last update, we mentioned we were working on a launch plan. Happy to say we've (almost) finalized our plans and have been hard at work BTS last month to execute our plans. The marketing material has started to drip on our Twitter in the form of Twitter Spaces. 

This month, we also onboarded Alex Cowan, whom I used to work with at prePO.io, to help us increase our press and media visibility. 

## The Good:

* Launched [3moji](https://3moji.app/) site 
* Solidifed a launch plan for 3moji 
* Partnered with multiple projects and DAOs to distribute whitelist tokens.
