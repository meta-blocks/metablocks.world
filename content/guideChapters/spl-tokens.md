## What is an SPL-token?

Solana blockchain tokens are called as SPL-tokens. SPL-Tokens are created using [token-program](https://spl.solana.com/token). 

Even though the native there is a way to create/transfer and manipulate spl-tokens using the solana native program, it is easier to use to do the same using **Anchor Framework**

In this series, we will use `Anchor Framework` extensively to understand the concepts.
