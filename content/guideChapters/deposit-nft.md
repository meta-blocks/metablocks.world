After creating a \`Universe\`, the next step is to deposit an NFT to the universe.

You can think of every deposited NFT as a component of your main character. All the deposited NFTs together constitute the \`meta NFT\`. The \`meta NFT\` combines the metadata of all component NFTs.

## How is an NFT stored in a universe?

* Seeds and bumps
* User seed
* Vault seed
* Associated Vault seed

## Storing NFT in the contract

### Tara Sample Application

### Determine seeds and bumps

### Make a program call

## Deposit receipts

When you deposit and NFT to a Meta Blocks universe. You receive a receipt NFT. This receipt NFT has the same metadata as the deposited NFT, but it cannot be transferred by the user. This receipt can only be used to get the component NFT back from the program.
