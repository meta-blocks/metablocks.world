## Outline

We will understand how to transfer a newly created mint in the previous chapter. The final outcome can be found [here](https://github.com/metablockshq/spl-token-chapters/tree/main/Chapter%205%20-%20Transfer%20New%20Mint) 

To transfer a new mint to an account, use `mint_to` instruction from `token` program.

## How to transfer the Minted token to an account?

Before transferring an `spl_token_mint` to an account, it is time to understand about Associated Token Account (ATA). 

The `spl_token_mint` can only be transferred to ATA. 

* ATA is normally generated off-chain. 
* ATA is PDA. ATA is generated by finding a suitable PDA
* On the client side, one could generate a ATA as follows 

Following code is an example ATA generation using `PublicKey.findProgramAddress` in  `@solana/web3.js` library.

### Add find ATA to test file

Add the following in the `spl-token.ts` test file.

```typescript
import {PublicKey} from "@solana/web3.js"
import { ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID } from "@solana/spl-token";

export const findAssociatedTokenAccount = async (
  payerKey: PublicKey,
  mintKey: PublicKey
) => {

  return await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
    [
      payerKey.toBuffer(), // could be any public key
      TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID.toBuffer(),
      mintKey.toBuffer(),
    ],
   ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID  
  );
};
```

As we can see above, ATA is generated using 

1. Any public address +
2. A mint address +
3. Token program ID address +
4. Associated Token Program ID.

You should pass ATA to an instruction to transfer a mint. Again, In the program, use `mint_to` instruction to transfer a newly created mint.

Now, back in the rust `lib.rs` file, we will write a `transfer` context and then we will write an instruction to transfer the spl-token-mint` to an ATA.

### How to create `transfer` context?

We create another `struct` called `TransferMint` context for `transfer_mint` instruction. 

First update the imports from `token` library

```rust
use anchor_spl::{token::{self, Mint, Token, TokenAccount}, associated_token::AssociatedToken};
```

Next create the `TransferMint` context.

```rust
// Transfer mint context
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct TransferMint<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
         seeds = [
            b"spl-token-mint".as_ref(),
         ],
        bump = vault.spl_token_mint_bump,
    )]
    pub spl_token_mint: Account<'info, Mint>, // ---> 1

    #[account(
        seeds = [
            b"vault"
        ],
        bump = vault.bump, // --> 2
    )]
    pub vault : Account<'info, Vault>, 

    #[account(
        init,
        payer = payer,
        associated_token::mint = spl_token_mint,
        associated_token::authority = payer
    )]
    pub payer_mint_ata: Box<Account<'info, TokenAccount>>,  // --> 3

    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>, // ---> 4

    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>, // ---> 5
    pub token_program: Program<'info, Token>,   // ---> 6
    
    pub rent: Sysvar<'info, Rent>, // ---> 7

    pub associated_token_program : Program<'info, AssociatedToken>  // ---> 8

}
```

So here is what's happening the `TransferMint` context

1. We have used the same `spl_token_mint` account. However, we are not instantiating this time. We use the `spl_token_mint_bump` that was stored in `Vault` state previously.
2. We get the `vault` account again by using stored `bump` from the `Vault` state
3. This time, we are passing an ATA for minting the `spl_token_mint` into the `payer_mint_ata` account. We are setting `associated_token::mint` to `spl_token_mint` and `associated_token::authority` to `payer` account.
4. We are passing the `payer` account from which the program deducts payment
5. `token_program` account is same as before
6. `system_program` account is same as described in the previously
7. `rent` account is same as previously. Here we are passing rent for creating `associated token account` 
8. `associated_token_program` account is passed for creating ATA. 

We will now create an instruction `transfer_mint` to transfer the `spl_token_mint` into an ATA.

We use the `mint_to` instruction from `token_program`. We will call the instruction via cross program invocation (CPI) to another program. Learn more about this [here](https://book.anchor-lang.com/anchor_in_depth/CPIs.html) 

```rust
    pub fn transfer_mint(ctx : Context<TransferMint>) -> Result<()> {
        let cpi_context = CpiContext::new(
            ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
            token::MintTo {
                mint: ctx.accounts.spl_token_mint.to_account_info(),
                to: ctx.accounts.payer_mint_ata.to_account_info(),
                authority: ctx.accounts.payer.to_account_info(),
            },
        );
        token::mint_to(cpi_context, 10)?; // we are minting 10 tokens
        Ok(())
    }
```

With this, the `spl_token_mint` is minted into the `payer_mint_ata` account.

Let us test this out by writing another test case in `spl-token.ts` file. Let's update the file like it shown below.

```typescript
// add this block into the describe block of the test file
it("should mint the spl-token-mint to payer_mint_ata", async () => {
    const [splTokenMint, _1] = await findSplTokenMintAddress();

    const [vaultMint, _2] = await findVaultAddress();

    const [payerMintAta, _3] = await findAssociatedTokenAccount(
      payer.publicKey,
      splTokenMint
    );

    const tx = await program.methods
      .transferMint()
      .accounts({
        splTokenMint: splTokenMint,
        vault: vaultMint,
        associatedTokenProgram: ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
        tokenProgram: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
        systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
        payerMintAta: payerMintAta,
        payer: payer.publicKey,
      })
      .signers([payer])
      .rpc();

    console.log("Your transaction signature", tx);
  });
```

Run the command 

```bash
anchor test
```

After this, you should be able to see the result like below.

With this, we have understood how to use `mint_to` to transfer new mint. In the next chapter we will discuss on how to transfer tokens between accounts.
