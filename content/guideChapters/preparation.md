## Create an anchor Project

We will generate an **anchor program** in this chapter. The final outcome of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/metablockshq/spl-token-chapters/tree/main/Chapter%202%20-%20Initialise%20Environment) 

### 1.  Run the following command

```bash
anchor init spl-token
```

This will initialise a project like this below.

Open in your favourite editor and start doing the changes. 

### 2. Run the below command

```bash
anchor test
```

This will install all dependencies of the project.

### 3. Change Program ID

Usually it is a good idea to change the ProgramID of the program. Get the public address of the `spl-token` program by running the following command

```bash
solana-keygen pubkey target/deploy/spl_token-keypair.json
```

This will give you the output as below

![](/img/content/guide-chapters/blog_image_2.png "program id")

Replace `29iiLtNregFkwH4n4K95GrKYcGUGC3F6D5thPE2jWQQs` in `declare_id` of `lib.rs` file

![](/img/content/guide-chapters/image_3.png "code")

Also replace the address in `Anchor.toml` file of the project

### 4. Backup the `deploy program keypair`.

In the `target/deploy` , there is  `spl_token-keypair.json`. Let us back this up. Later, we will use the same `keypair` to deploy to `devnet`

Let's copy this to `env` folder in the project folder. You should be able to see something like this.

**WARNING** :  **For the demonstration purpose we have exposed the `spl_token-keypair.json` in the `env` folder. It is advisable to keep this a secret!**


With this we are ready to create our first mint. In the next chapter, will look at creating a new mint
